### [TAMU Library Tutorial](https://library.tamu.edu/services/library_tutorials/citing_sources/index.html){:target="_blank"}
The TAMU libraries offers a helpful tutorial on citations and the 
different citation styles used in academic writing. 


### Citation Styles for Ancient History
Below you will find links for the _Chicago Manual of Style_ (Chicago) and for 
Kate Turabian's _Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_ 
(Turabian).  You many use either of these when citing sources. Turabian is 
basically a streamlined version of Chicago so you may use these two styles 
interchangeably. I recommend starting with Turabian and then looking elsewhere 
if you are unable to find what you need. Things can get very technical. Always 
remember that two guidelines trump everything else. 1) Your reader must always be 
able to find the source you have cited easily; and 2) your citation style should 
be consistent throughout your document. 

#### [Turabian: Style Handout](https://library.tamu.edu/help/help-yourself/citing-sources/files/Using%20Turabian%20Format.pdf){:target="_blank"}
Note here the different citation formats based on where the citation appears. You 
want the form labeled "F" for your footnotes and the form labeled "B" for your 
bibliography. You wont need the others.


#### [Turabian: Quick Guide](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/turabian_citationguide.html){:target="_blank"}
This list contains formatting for footnotes (those starting with a number) and 
bibliographies (those starting with the author's last name).

Note the difference between the formatting for a footnote that refers to the 
first citation of a source and the formatting of a footnote that refers to subsequent 
citations of the same source.

***IMPORTANT:*** None of the formats here offers an example of something you are 
very likely to run into, the citation of a work contained within a book. You will 
need this if you cite from an anthology or reader but you will also need this if 
you cite from something like the Nicene and Post-Nicene Father, a collection of volumes 
that contains several entire ancient works bound together into a single volume. The 
proper citation format will combine the "Editor or translator in addition to author" 
section and the "Chapter or other part of a book" section of Turabian. Here is an 
example:

1. John Chrysostom, Treatise to the Fallen Monk, in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, trans. W. R. W. Stephens, (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1995), 102.

John Chrysostom. _Treatise to the Fallen Monk_. In _Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 
First Series_, translated by W. R. W. Stephens, 87-111. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson 
Publishers, 1995.
