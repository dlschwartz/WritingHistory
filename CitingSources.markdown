### [TAMU Library Tutorial](https://library.tamu.edu/services/library_tutorials/citing_sources/index.html){:target="_blank"}
The TAMU libraries offers a helpful tutorial on citations and the 
different citation styles used in academic writing. 


### Citation Styles for Ancient History
Below you will find links for the _Chicago Manual of Style_ (Chicago) and for 
Kate Turabian's _Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_ 
(Turabian).  You many use either of these when citing sources. Turabian is 
basically a streamlined version of Chicago so you may use these two styles 
interchangeably. I recommend starting with Turabian and then looking elsewhere 
if you are unable to find what you need. Things can get very technical. Always 
remember that two guidelines trump everything else. 1) Your reader must always be 
able to find the source you have cited easily; and 2) your citation style should 
be consistent throughout your document. 

#### [Turabian: Style Handout](https://library.tamu.edu/help/help-yourself/citing-sources/files/Using%20Turabian%20Format.pdf){:target="_blank"}
Note here the different citation formats based on where the citation appears. You 
want the form labeled "F" for your footnotes and the form labeled "B" for your 
bibliography. You wont need the others.


#### [Turabian: Quick Guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/turabian/turabian-notes-and-bibliography-citation-quick-guide.html){:target="_blank"}
This list contains formatting for footnotes (those starting with a number) and 
bibliographies (those starting with the author's last name).

Note the difference between the formatting for a footnote that refers to the 
first citation of a source and the formatting of a footnote that refers to subsequent 
citations of the same source.

The link above will take you to the online edition of the _Chicago Manual of Style_. 
It contains many more examples than the Turabian materials cited above.

#### <a name="insertingFootnotes"/>[Inserting Footnotes](./#insertingFootnotes)
You can create something that looks like a footnote by adding a superscripted number at the end of a sentence
and then adding a corresponding number down in the footer. This is NOT a good way to insert a footnote into 
your paper. Word processing programs have a feature that inserts sequentially numbered footnotes
for you and manages their location on the proper page. This means that your footnote stays with the proper text. 
This allows you to cut, paste, and otherwise edit your work without having to manually change footnote 
numbers. Here are links to tutorials on how to use this feature in 
[MS Word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9_dw_CxG6w){:target="_blank"} and in 
[Google Docs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6CzEd7dr5s){:target="_blank"}. 


#### <a name="essaysVsBooks"/>[Collected Volumes vs. Monographs](./#essaysVsBooks)
A book of essays written by multiple authors and edited by one or more editors is 
usually referred to as a 'collected volume.' You generally cite these by the author and 
title of the essay/chapter while also indicating the title and editor for book. See this example in the 
[Chicago Manual of Style](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.srv-proxy1.library.tamu.edu/book/ed17/part3/ch14/psec107.html){:target="_blank"}.

A book written by a single author is sometimes called a 'monograph.' That means it is a 
book written by a single author (or occassionally by co-authors but the important thing
is that it is not a collection of essays written by separate authors). When citing a 
monograph, please cite the whole book and not the individual chapters contained in the book.
Your footnote will include a page number that your reader can use to see 
which parts of the monograph you are citing. If you need to discuss a chapter as a distinct
part of the book, you can do that in the body of your paper.

#### <a name="shortForm"/>[Short Form of Footnotes](./#shortForm) 
In order to reduce the space take up by the footnotes, you want to offer a 
full citation the first time you cite a work and then use the short form for 
each subsequent citation of that work. The short form includes only the author's 
last name, an abbreviated title of the book or article (in italics or quotation marks 
as appropriate) and a page number. For some examples of full and short form citations, see 
[Chicago Manual of Style](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.srv-proxy1.library.tamu.edu/book/ed17/part3/ch14/psec030.html){:target="_blank"}.


#### <a name="allCaps"/>[Remove All-Caps from Citations](./#allCaps)
Many online bibliographies and library catalogs put titles or author names in 
all-caps. Whether you cut and paste into your citations or re-type these references 
you do not want to include the all-caps in your footnotes or bibliography. It creates 
the impression that you are yelling at your reader which is probably not what you 
intend.

#### <a name="ancientAuthor"/>[Cite by Ancient Author](./#ancientAuthor)
The modern editor of an ancient source is not the author and should not be 
listed where you would normally list the author of a work. You should list the 
editor and/or translator after the title of the work. See this example in the 
[Chicago Manual of Style](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.srv-proxy1.library.tamu.edu/book/ed17/part3/ch14/psec104.html){:target="_blank"}.

#### <a name="workInCollection"/>[How to Cite Ancient Works in a Collection](./#workInCollection) 
The formats described in the links above do not offer a clear example of something you are 
very likely to run into, the citation of an ancient work contained within a book. You will 
need this if you cite from an anthology or reader but you will also need this if 
you cite from something like the [Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers](https://dlschwartz.github.io/WritingHistory/Research/#primaries), a collection of volumes 
that contains several entire ancient works bound together into single volumes. The 
proper citation format will combine the "Editor or translator in addition to author" 
section and the "Chapter or other part of a book" section of Turabian. Here is an 
example:
