### <a name="overview"/>General Overview
Patrick Rael has produced an excellent resource on historical writing for students, 
[Reading, Writing, and Researching for History: A Guide for College Students](http://www.bowdoin.edu/writing-guides/){:target="_blank"}.
I highly recommend that you spend some time reading this site.

### <a name="draft"/>My Expectations for an Undergraduate Term Paper: Draft
A draft is by definition a work in progress. You should always begin writing long before 
you have everything figured out. We learn by writing so writing must be a iterative 
process that begins with ideas which then get refined through the process of writing. 
When submitting a rough draft for a class, you will nevertheless want to include the 
following:
* Clearly stated thesis statement (or hypothesis if your thesis is still evolving).
The clarity is the critical part. 
* Interaction with primary sources
* Interaction with secondary sources
* Footnotes — avoid the temptation of putting them off citations until the last minute!
* Bibliography


### <a name="final"/>My Expectations for an Undergraduate Term Paper: Final

#### <a name="thesis"/>Thesis Statements
Your paper should contain a clear, focused, and arguable thesis statement that contains
your value added contribution.
* “Clear” means that your reader ought to be able to identify your thesis without 
any question in the matter. Given the fact that undergraduate writing assignments 
tend to be rather short, you probably want to put your thesis on the first page, 
if not in the first paragraph. This will help you get on with your argument but 
will also make your thesis easy to identify.
* “Focused” means that your thesis should be appropriate to the length of the 
assignment. You cannot detail the history of the entire Roman economy in 3000 
words. Proposing a thesis focused on the close analysis of a couple of primary 
source texts will greatly help you produce a compelling argument.
* “Arguable” means that a good thesis cannot simply state the obvious. It must 
propose an argument on which different students of the subject could legitimately 
disagree. “Rome won a lot of wars in the process of becoming a Mediterranean empire” 
does not offer an arguable thesis. An example of an arguable thesis would be 
something like this: “Although Rome won many military victories, the secret to 
Roman success must be located in the Roman ability to engage successfully in 
diplomacy.” (N.B. This example is not focused enough to meet the expectations of 
requirement b. above but helps make a point about what constitutes an "arguable" 
thesis.)
* “Value added” means that your thesis must set up a paper that will offer ideas 
that belong to you. Your thesis and argument should not merely repackage the work 
you find in your secondary sources. In articulating an arguable thesis, it helps 
if that thesis comes from your own careful reading and interpretation of primary 
sources.
* One convenient way to find an arguable thesis with a clear value added is to 
locate an ongoing scholarly debate and weigh in on it by re-interpreting a primary 
source text or bring to the debate a source that those engaged in that debate have 
not dealt with sufficiently.

#### <a name="primaries"/>Interaction with Primary Sources
* A close reading of sources demonstrates careful interpretation and analysis 
of sources. You cannot prove a thesis without closely reading primary sources. 
* Make sure you understand the context of a primary source before using it in 
your writing. You should avoid quoting from anthologies or lifting primary 
quotations from secondary sources. If something is worth quoting, it is worth 
reading in its broader context.
* Always analyze the primary sources you use in your paper, especially when 
you quote them. The presence of a primary source quotation does not, and indeed 
cannot prove, your point. Your interpretation must make explicit how the sources 
support your thesis. 
* Anything worth quoting is worth interpreting explicitly. Anything not worth 
interpreting explicitly is not worth quoting.

#### <a name="secondaries"/>Interaction with Secondary Sources
* This requires careful negotiation of your relationship with secondary sources 
relevant to proving your thesis. Sometimes this simply means that secondary 
sources offer a source of information that you do not have the time or skills 
to prove in your paper. More importantly, however, this means that your thesis 
statement and the argument you use to prove that thesis statement will interact 
with what scholars in the field have already said about your topic. The two most 
common ways to do this are to agree with, but offer an improvement on, someone’s 
argument, or to critique someone’s argument. (N.B. A summary of secondary sources 
is not a research paper!)
* Quoting a secondary source cannot prove your point. It might support your argument, 
but it cannot in and of itself prove your point. Show how the source supports _your_ 
argument.

#### <a name="footnotes"/>Footnotes
* “Footnotes” means that you should not use parenthetical citations! 
* “Footnotes” means that you should not use endnotes! 
* Footnotes must be properly formatted according to the Chicago Manual of Style 
or Kate Turabian’s A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations.
* See the [Citations page](../Citations) of this website for more detail.

#### <a name="bibliography"/>Bibligraphy/Works Cited
* Bibliography must be properly formatted according to the Chicago Manual of 
Style or Kate Turabian’s A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and 
Dissertations. See the [Citations page](../Citations) of this website for more detail.
* Take particular care with the difference between an ancient author and a 
modern editor of an ancient text. The modern editor was not the author of your 
ancient source. The author is the author and the editor is the editor. Know the 
difference and cite your sources accordingly. See [here](../Citations/#workInCollection) 
for help citing a work in a collection.


#### <a name="formatting"/>Formatting
* Please do not include a title page. Simply put your name and this class at the 
top of the page along with the word count of your paper (use the word count feature 
in MS Word). 
* Give your paper a title. A title is a great place to begin the process of 
engaging your reader. Consider something clever (but not silly), or incorporate 
a short quotation from your primary source reading, or offer something that foreshadows 
your argument.
* Consider using section and sub-section headings. These signpost to your reader where 
your argument is going and facilitates transitions between the separate ideas that 
go into making your argument.
* Your assignment asks you to write within a certain word range. Edit your paper 
to ensure that it is within this range. Put the word count at the top of the first page.
* Include page numbers.
* If you will write about physical objects for which you could include images, 
create an appendix and number each image: figure 1, figure 2, etc. In the body 
of your text, you may then simply refer your reader to the figure you are discussing. 
Of course, you will want to include the source of your images in your bibliography.

#### <a name="revising"/>Revising
* Revise your thesis and argument to make sure that your thesis is appropriate 
to your argument and your argument proves your thesis.
* Revise your prose to ensure that you employ proper grammar, clear sentences, 
and smooth transitions between ideas, sections, and paragraphs.
* Look for passive verbs (is, am, are, was, were, be, being, been, have, has, had) 
and consider ways to reduce or even eliminate them. The occasional use of passive 
does not present a problem but the frequent use tends to take the life out of your 
writing. For more on passive voice, see: <https://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Students/Writing-Speaking-Guides/Alphabetical-List-of-Guides/Drafting/Active-Passive-Voice/>{:target="_blank"}.
* Revise your text, footnotes, and bibliography to ensure that you give proper 
credit where credit is due.

#### <a name="reminders"/>Writing/Revising Reminders
* Use proper [grammar](https://www.niu.edu/writingtutorial/grammar/index.shtml){:target="_blank"}, 
[punctuation](https://www.niu.edu/writingtutorial/punctuation/index.shtml){:target="_blank"}, and spelling. 
* You generally want to avoid using the first person (I, my, we, etc.)
* Avoid contractions (don’t, shouldn’t, etc.)
