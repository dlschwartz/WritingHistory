### <a name="reference"/>Reference Works
Use the reference works linked in this folder to look up the answers to questions 
that might develop during your reading. These reference works also offer the 
best place for you to begin searching for the secondary literature you will 
want to consider for academic writing.

#### [Cambridge Ancient History](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://histories.cambridge.org/uid=9575/collection?id=set_cambridge_ancient_history){:target="_blank"}
This multi-volume work contains essays on specific topics. Note that each volume also 
has a bibliography arranged according to theme. I highly recommend using these 
bibliographies as you pursue topics and research your papers.

#### [The Encyclopedia of Ancient History](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444338386){:target="_blank"}
This digital encyclopedia contains excellent entries on a broad range of historical 
topics. Note that every entry has a bibliography attached that allows you to find 
additional bibliographical references for that topic.

#### [Brill's New Pauly](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://coral.library.tamu.edu/resourcelink.php?resource=1132){:target="_blank"}
Brill's New Pauly is an encyclopedia of classical antiquity. 

#### [Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://www.credoreference.com/book/hupla){:target="_blank"}
This is an unconventional but helpful book. The first half contains a collection 
of essays that might be helpful for understanding the context of your research topic. 
The second half is more like an encyclopedia with short articles and bibliography.

#### [A Companion to Late Antiquity](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444306101){:target="_blank"}
This collection of essays offers a helpful introduction to key issues in the study 
of Late Antiquity. I recommend you select a couple of these to read for background 
relevant to the topic you choose for your research paper.

#### [Oxford Bibliographies Online](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://coral.library.tamu.edu/resourcelink.php?resource=2629){:target="_blank"}
Several of these online bibliographies contain material relevant to doing research 
in ancient history.


### <a name="databases"/>
The online databases linked here are essential research tools. However, they 
are generally best consulted after you have a pretty clear sense of the 
topic you want to research. I recommend starting with the resources in the 
[Reference Works](#reference) section before doing search in these databases.

#### [ERIC (EBSCO)](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=https://coral.library.tamu.edu/resourcelink.php?resource=1960){:target="_blank"}

#### [JSTOR](http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=https://coral.library.tamu.edu/resourcelink.php?resource=2288){:target="_blank"}
