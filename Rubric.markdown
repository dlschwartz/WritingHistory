## Grading Rubric for Historical Writing
The following rubric is adapted from the one formerly used by the Princeton University 
History department. It appears this document is no longer available online.

#### A
An “A” paper (100-90%) is one that is good enough to be read aloud in a class. 
It is clearly written and well-organized. It demonstrates that the writer has 
conducted a close and critical reading of primary and secondary texts, grappled 
with the issues raised in the course, synthesized the readings, discussions, and 
lectures, and formulated a perceptive, compelling, independent argument. The 
argument shows intellectual originality and creativity, is sensitive to historical 
context, is supported by a well-chosen variety of specific examples, and, in the 
case of a research paper, is built on a critical reading of primary material.

#### B
A “B” paper (89-80%) demonstrates many aspects of A-level work but falls short 
of it in either the organization and clarity of its writing, the formulation and 
presentation of its argument, or the quality of research. Some papers or exams in 
this category are solid works containing flashes of insight into many of the 
issues raised in the course. Others give evidence of independent thought, but 
the argument is not presented clearly or convincingly.

#### C
A “C” paper (79-70%) offers little more than a mere a summary of ideas and 
information covered in the course or in the secondary literature consulted, 
is insensitive to historical context, suffers from frequent factual errors, 
unclear writing, poor organization, or inadequate primary research, or presents 
some combination of these problems.

Whereas the grading standards for written work between A and C are concerned 
with the presentation of argument and evidence, a paper that belongs to the D 
or F categories demonstrates inadequate command of course material and/or a 
failure to adequately respond to the writing prompt or assignment.

#### D
A “D” paper (69-60%) demonstrates serious deficiencies or severe flaws in the 
student's command of course or research material.

#### F
An “F” paper (59% or lower) demonstrates little or no competence in the course 
or research materials. It indicates a student's neglect or lack of effort for 
the assignment.
