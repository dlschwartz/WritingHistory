## Resources for Students Writing Ancient History
This page contains a set of resources for students engaged in writing ancient history 
in my courses at Texas A&M University. 

Be under no illusions that what I offer here is somehow complete or 
comprehensive of everything students will need to effectively read, interpret, 
and write about ancient history. Rather, these resources address some of the 
things that I have found students struggle with the most when it comes to writing
about ancient sources at the college level. Some resources I have created myself while 
in other cases I have found helpful resources online and simply link to those resources
rather than reinvent the wheel. 

If you know of additional resourses please feel free to 
share them with me and I may include them for the benefit of other students.
